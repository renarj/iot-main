# Robotics Project
This repository contains all my Robotics projects, currently we have two active robot design
* A humanoid robot which is the active project (called project Maximus)
* A rover robot which is currently inactive

## Humanoid Robot Maximus
The Humanoid robot is an open source Humanoid robot where the intent is to develop this into a fully functional walking humanoid robot.

**Current status:**
* 3D design v2 is finished, expect further iterations as we explore walking possibilities for the robot.
* Electronics design is based on a Intel NUC as controller and a custom designed PCB for Servo control and power distribution
* Basic motion control and motion editor in place in Java code

**Roadmap:**
* Start defining inverse kinematics model
* Define walking gaits / model
* Develop a fully battery / lipo powered robot model, currently electronics requires external 12 Volt power source with 10 Amp ability.
